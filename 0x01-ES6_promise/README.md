# Project: ES6 Promise

## Description
This project contains a series of exercises and tasks related to ES6 Promises. Each file represents a specific task that involves working with Promises and related concepts such as async/await, error handling, and Promise chaining.

## File Structure
- **0-promise.js:** Prototype function to return a Promise.
- **1-promise.js:** Returning a Promise based on a boolean argument.
- **2-then.js:** Handling response from an API using .then() and .catch().
- **3-all.js:** Handling multiple Promises concurrently using Promise.all().
- **4-user-promise.js:** Creating and resolving a Promise to simulate user signup.
- **5-photo-reject.js:** Creating and rejecting a Promise to simulate photo upload.
- **6-final-user.js:** Handling profile signup using multiple Promises and Promise.allSettled().
- **7-load_balancer.js:** Implementing a load balancer to resolve Promises based on their resolution time.
- **8-try.js:** Implementing error handling using try...catch with Promises.
- **9-guardrail.js:** Handling errors and values returned by a function using .finally().

## Usage
To run each file and see the output, execute the following command:
npm run dev <filename>
Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to execute.

## ESLint
ESLint has been configured to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues in the code. You can run ESLint to check the code by executing the following command:
npm run lint <filename>

## Environment
- Node.js version: 12.22.12
- ES6 compatibility: ES6 features are used in the codebase.
